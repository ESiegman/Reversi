### General Rules of Reversi
- The game begins with two black discs and two white discs placed in the center of the board in a diagonal pattern.
- The first player is determined at random.
- Players take turns placing discs on the board with their assigned color facing up.
- A valid move must outflank one or more of the opponent's discs in a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- Outflanked discs are flipped to the current player's color.
- If a player cannot make a valid move, they must pass their turn.
- The game ends when neither player can make a valid move.
- The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

Enjoy playing Reversi!
